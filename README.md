This project introduces a novel algorithm for Routing and
 Wavelength Assignment (RWA) in Elastic Optical Networks (EONs),
 designed to enhance overall network efficiency and performance. The
 proposed algorithm will handle both single-hop and multi-hop grooming
 strategies; thus, the offered total resource utilization and spectrum effi
ciency under dynamic traffic demands are ensured to be optimum. MBP,
 which is the Mean Blocking Probability, quantifies, measures bandwidth
 usage efficiency; and finally, Jainâ€™s Fairness Index (JFI), which assesses
 fairness in the distribution of resources among users. The proposed algo
rithm, in minimising the blocking probability, enhancing bandwidth util
isation, and ensuring fair resource allocation, is proved to reduce critical
 challenges with EONs and, thus, offers a cost-effective, adaptive, efficient,
 and fair solution for the growing demand for high-bandwidth services.
